#flashlight demo

A 'flashlight' effect in the HTML5 canvas using a background canvas, a filter canvas, and an output canvas that renders the filter effect wherever your mouse is hovering.  Unlike most canvas filters, this does not use the globalCompositeOperation, thus making it compatible with most browsers.
