# HTML5 Canvas Spotlight effect


A 'spotlight' effect in the HTML5 canvas using a background canvas, a filter canvas, and an output canvas that renders the filter effect wherever your mouse is hovering.  Unlike most canvas filters, this does not use the built-in blend modes or `globalCompositeOperation`, thus making it compatible with most browsers.
